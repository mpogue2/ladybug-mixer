# ladybug-mixer
Portable, low-cost audio mixer for square dance callers

# Version 2 files
- SCH = schematic
- GERBER = PC board layout
- BOM = Bill of Materials (specifies which parts to place onto the board)
- PickAndPlace = specifies where to place parts onto the board

# NOTES
- To keep the schematic symbols looking nice, the schematic uses a small number of parts that have the same PCB footprint as the real parts, but have better symbols.  What gets submitted for PCB fabrication is NOT the schematic, it's the GERBER files, the BOM, and the PickAndPlace file.
